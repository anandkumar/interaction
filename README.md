Interaction
===========
Interaction is a WordPress parent theme based on Hybrid Framework. Actually this is forked from Stargazer. One of the most trending theme at [ThemeHybrid](http://themehybrid.com).

##Why "Interaction"?
I wants to create a theme which have all ingredients of modern web. But when someone installs a theme s/he stuck at some point. I am trying to make a balance between your desire and what you got in a theme, without adjusting things.

Interaction do not have a control panel, if you expected. However, I have plan to add a setting page or provide options in customizer. But this is something not in my priority.

##Why "Stargazer"?
You may wonder why I made this theme by *copying and pasting* codes. It's the beauty of GNU GPL License (and of course Justin Tadlock). 

Stargazer is no doubt have solid base and made around hybrid framework. AND solid WordPress Support.

## What will be in the theme?
The theme is all about "interaction". It's all about conveying your message, thoughts or even products to your visitors.
1. All responsive web design
2. A modern homepage, full-width
3. HTML5 & CSS3 support
4. Elegant design
...
